## Overview

This repository houses a collection of machine learning scripts and notebooks developed during my university studies. The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location for these educational materials, making them easily accessible for future reference and for anyone interested in learning about machine learning.

## Installation

To get started with the contents of this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PratikTusharGokhale/General-Purpose.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd General-Purpose
```

Depending on the specific scripts or notebooks you want to use, you may need to install additional dependencies. Each subdirectory will contain a `requirements.txt` file if additional Python packages are needed.

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each script or notebook in this repository is located in its own subdirectory. Navigate to the relevant subdirectory to find detailed usage instructions.

### Example Usage

1. **Navigate to the desired project directory**:
